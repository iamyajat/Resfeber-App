# Resfeber 
## Problem Statement
We often forget things to carry when we are going on a trip. To tackle this problem. Create a solution to help passengers maintain a checklist depending on the type of trip.
## Inspiration
I travel a lot and recently travelled to New Delhi for medical reasons. Inspite of being a frequent traveller I still misplan my travel, I forget to pack of important things. This either hinders my travel experience or results in me spending extra bucks to buy what I already have. I personally understand the pain-point the prolem statement indicates and hence I was inspired to build this .
## What it does
We built a simple checklist first. But then that is not cool right? We added several features.
We intelligently add items to the checklist based on weather and location details.
We show the live insta feed of that location to give user an idea of the place
We show covid guidelines of the state
We let the user to upload the travel docs to the app for easy access. 
## How we built it
We teamed up first . Divided work of Android Dev and Backend . The backend team made the APIs and after we were done we all organised a meet to integrate the components.
## How to run it locally
The backend server is hosted on Heroku. You can access it at https://resfeber-service.herokuapp.com/ (Please dont spam request because we got no time to implement rate limiter :( )
## Challenges we ran into
One of the common problem that i run into in all the hackathons including this is that it becomes really difficult to integrate the moving parts at the last moment.
ALso we used several API. 
Some of the required a credit card which was not available :(
Some of the required a developer account which was not available :(
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making this complex peoduct within 24 hrs with several moving part is what I am proud of.
## What we learned
We learnt work in team. We followed the git protocol like feature branching relegiously.
